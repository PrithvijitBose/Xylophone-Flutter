# Xylophone ðŸŽ¹

## Our Goal

The Xylophone Flutter App is a simple, interactive musical instrument application that allows users to play different musical notes by tapping on colored keys. Each key corresponds to a different note, creating a fun and educational experience.

## What you will create

Weâ€™re going to make a music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are.
